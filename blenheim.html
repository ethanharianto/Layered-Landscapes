                  Blenheim Palace is not only a site important to English
                  Heritage, but UNESCO also deemed it a World
                  Heritage Site. Although it is widely attributed to Sir Winston
                  Churchill today, it was given to the
                  First Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill, after his victory
                  over French and Bavarian troops in 1704,
                  which is said to have decided the future of the British
                  Empire. It fulfills criteria (ii) and (iv) for
                  selection onto the world heritage list: “to exhibit an
                  important interchange of human values, over a
                  span of time or within a cultural area of the world, on
                  developments in architecture or technology,
                  monumental arts, town-planning or landscape design;” and, “to
                  be an outstanding example of a type of
                  building, architectural or technological ensemble or landscape
                  which illustrates (a) significant
                  stage(s) in human history.” Unlike the Rhodes statue, Blenheim
                  Palace does not have a shroud of
                  controversy, but it has evolved from a residence of an English
                  aristocracy to, when I visited, a place
                  centered around one of England’s favorite leaders, Sir Winston
                  Churchill. Why is that?

                As I mentioned before, the palace was meant to be a reward to
                the Duke of Marlborough for a victory, which
                may have brought about the end of the War of the Spanish
                Succession; however, at the time of his death, it
                was not even finished. While the Palace is not controversial
                now, it used to be. Samuel J. Rogal puts it
                simply, “The basis for all controversy and difficulty
                surrounding the building of Blenheim Palace was,
                simply, money.” The architect, John Vanbrugh, had originally had
                a cost of £40,000 in mind, but that
                ballooned up to no less than £325,000 by the palace’s
                completion. Now since the Duke had already passed,
                who was handing over the money? It was none other than his wife,
                Sarah Churchill, who did so quite annoyed
                as she believed Vanbrugh to be deceitful in his costs. I believe
                this shows the pomposity of the English
                aristocracy because although the cost continued to rise, she
                decided the palace still needed to be done.
                The dukes that succeeded John Churchill then continued to pour
                more money into the palace for smoking
                rooms, painting exhibits, china collections, and repairs.
              </p><p>
                In 1712, visitors were allowed to be shown around by the
                comptroller for free. In the mid-18th century,
                Oxford tours began with fees that were regarded as exorbitant.
                In the later 18th century, opening hours
                were restricted to certain hours in the afternoon with a few
                public days in the summer. In the 19th
                century, the duke at the time then allowed shooting and fishing
                by the hour; however, his successor raised
                the entry fee which was followed by public outrage. In the late
                19th century, the family began to live
                more in the palace (I have no idea why they would not want to
                reside there the whole year) so public
                access was further restricted. This all changed in the First
                World War, also known as the Great War, in
                which the long library was turned into a hospital ward. The
                palace was then used again in the Second World
                War by the Intelligence Service, the British Council, and the
                Ministry of Supply. After the war, the
                palace was restored and its doors opened once again to the
                public.

                  We have answered my original question of how the palace turned
                  from a residence of aristocracy to a tourist trap. However,
                  what does this mean in terms of the overarching research
                  question? From what we learned, this place of cultural
                  heritage has changed. It used to be an exclusive place where
                  even notable visitors were not given the time of day, and now
                  anyone can go in (if they can afford to go in). What does that
                  mean for its meaning? Well, it used to represent exclusivity,
                  aristocracy, and loosely imperialism. However, it seems to now
                  represent the government and the transfer of power thereof.
                  While there are still countless aristocratic artifacts, much
                  of the palace exhibits are centered around Sir Winston
                  Churchill. How does that now contribute to the English
                  identity? The transfer of power from the aristocracy to the
                  popular government allowed the common voice that was heard to
                  change from being a noble to truly the common person. As
                  Arlette Farge described, back in the day, the common people
                  were not heard because the nobles were taking up all the air
                  time. And in a way, I believe Winston Churchill represents
                  this feeling.
